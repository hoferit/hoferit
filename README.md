### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael Hofer (he/him)

##### About Me
Hi! I'm Michael. After many years in the fields of music and hospitality, I decided to transform my passion for digital media and games into a career in web development. It presented me with an opportunity to challenge myself and delve deep into the fascinating world of coding.

Today, as a full-stack developer, I find joy in creating user-friendly, robust web applications. My tech stack includes Next.js 13, Prisma, Postgres, TypeScript, SCSS, Tailwind, and Figma.

##### Special Interests
My areas of special interest are accessibility (a11y) and database design. I am excited about learning more about these fields and making meaningful contributions.
